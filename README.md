# 2016 US Bike Share Activity Snapshot

## Introduction

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, an exploratory analysis has been performed on the data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. The system usage is compared between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC.
