# 2016 US Bike Share Activity Snapshot

## Introduction

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, an exploratory analysis has been performed on the data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. The system usage is compared between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC.

## Installations
Python 3, Jupyter Notebook

```
import csv
from datetime import datetime 
from pprint import pprint
```


## Data Collection

The data has been included in `data` folder.

The original data was from:

- New York City (Citi Bike): [Link](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
- Chicago (Divvy): [Link](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)
- Washington, DC (Capital Bikeshare): [Link](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)
